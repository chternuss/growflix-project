# growflix-project

Growflix is a web streaming platform developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, inspired by the visual identity and layout of Netflix. This project is a practical challenge to apply and solidify front-end development skills.

Project Highlights:

- Bootstrap was used for the projectâ€™s visual structure, with a few adjustments made using custom CSS.
- CSS variables were implemented to ensure consistent color usage throughout the project.
- Cards and the highlighted video are dynamically rendered based on the data-movie.js and home.js files.

Known Issues:

- On the home.html page, the banner/highlighted video image does not fully match the example provided by Growdev. This happens because the image is pulled directly from YouTube, which adds black borders to the top and bottom.
